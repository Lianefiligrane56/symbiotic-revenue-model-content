### 1. Resources Used for Data Inputs

- [Symbiotic Dune Rewards v1](https://dune.com/symbiotic/symbiotic-rewards)
- [Q3 Financial Statements and Adjustments](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hhaH-WtHp_qplQ16KgCjNb_WaYjchmmI)
- [Symbiotic Dune v2 Core Stats](https://dune.com/symbiotic/symbiotic-core-stats)

*Next to the provided Staking Rewards v1 Dune Dashboard I have also considered the v2 Core Stats Data as they give Insights on Protocol Revenue Drivers and have corrected the monthly costs by the difference of the lower operating costs as indicated in the Cash Flow Statement and Profit & Loss Statement of the Supplier Cost Side.*

# ### 2. Model Implementation
I have chosen Hex to present the model as it allows to create FinOps Suite that 
- allows to include data from various resources as API, data base queries, file imports 
-  runs regular data updates
- create custom financial tables, visualisations 
- present calculations with context
- run scenarios analysis with an easy dashboard to change key assumptions without the risk of damaging formulas
- risk kpis and complex price or risk simulation like instituional grade stress tests
- Allows sub-dashboards for various stakeholders and reporting structures
- allows data and chart exports and delivers file exports for regular reporting purposes 
- low maintenance and easy to use by all key stakeholders
