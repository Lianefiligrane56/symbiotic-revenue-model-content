# ### 2. Model Implementation

I have chosen Hex to present the model as it allows to create FinOps Suite that 
- allows to include data from various resources as API, data base queries, file imports 
-  runs regular data updates
- create custom financial tables, visualisations 
- present calculations with context
- run scenarios analysis with an easy dashboard to change key assumptions without the risk of damaging formulas
- risk kpis and complex price or risk simulation like instituional grade stress tests
- Allows sub-dashboards for various stakeholders and reporting structures
- allows data and chart exports and delivers file exports for regular reporting purposes 
- low maintenance and easy to use by all key stakeholders
