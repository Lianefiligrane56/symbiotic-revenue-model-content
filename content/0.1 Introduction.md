## 1. Resources Used for Data Inputs
### a. Historic Financial Statements
- [Q3 Financial Statements and Adjustments](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hhaH-WtHp_qplQ16KgCjNb_WaYjchmmI)
I have used an approximation for historic P&L data per month based on the provided statements.
Next to that, I have corrected the monthly costs by the difference of the lower operating costs as indicated in the Cash Flow Statement and Profit & Loss Statement of the Supplier Cost Side. 
### b. Historic Protocol Data
- [Symbiotic Dune Rewards v1](https://dune.com/symbiotic/symbiotic-rewards)
- [Symbiotic Dune v2 Core Stats](https://dune.com/symbiotic/symbiotic-core-stats)
 *Next to the Rewards v1 Dune Dashboard data I have also considered the v2 Core Stats Data, as they give Insights on Protocol Revenue Drivers 

## 2. Historic Data Computations

| Metric                                    | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **TVL at Date ($)**                       | Total dollar value of all assets deposited/staked in Symbiotic protocol at a specific point in time. Measures protocol size, user confidence, and capital available for network security.                                            |
| **TVL v1 and v2**                         | Breakdown of Total Value Locked between Symbiotic's original protocol version (v1) and updated version (v2). Shows migration progress and which implementation users prefer.                                                         |
| **Cumulative Staking Rewards ($)**        | Total rewards earned by all stakers across ALL networks since protocol inception. Lifetime sum of every reward distributed through Symbiotic.                                                                                        |
| **Restaking Rewards ($)**                 | Rewards specifically from restaking activities where users stake already-staked assets (like stETH) to secure additional protocols simultaneously. Subset of Cumulative Staking Rewards showing capital efficiency.                  |
| **Network Security Fees (Hyperlane) ($)** | HYPER token rewards paid by Hyperlane Foundation to validators and stakers securing cross-chain messaging infrastructure. Token emissions (not revenue) used to incentivize network security - currently unsustainable.              |
| **L2s (Tanssi) ($)**                      | TANSSI token rewards paid by Tanssi Foundation to stakers securing their appchain/L2 deployment platform. Token emissions distributed to providers of economic security for rollup infrastructure.                                   |
| **Private Credit (Cap) ($)**              | Rewards paid to restakers providing insurance/credit guarantees for Cap protocol's lending operations. Derived from actual trading profits of operators (market makers, arbitrageurs) - sustainable real yield, not token emissions. |
| **Average APY (%)**                       | Average Annual Percentage Yield earned by stakers across all Symbiotic networks. Calculated as (Annual Rewards ÷ Average TVL) × 100. Represents return on capital for security providers.                                            |
